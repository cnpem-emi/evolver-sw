eVOLVER Server Code - CNPEM APPROACH
===================

This code sits on the eVOLVER BeagleBone Black and handles communications between the DPU and the SAMD21 microcontrollers that monitor and actuate experimental parameters.
Calibrations, experiment commands, and data transmission are all handled by this code.

Installation
============

If you need to, you can install all dependencies by running the following command:

``python3.6 setup.py install``

NOTE: You must use python3.6 at this point in time - some of the dependencies currently do not work on 3.7.

Running the server
